	my_mousedev.c , task3.c
================================================

This directory contains 2 files:

my_mousedev.c	---	Most of the file is same as the mousedev.c file present driver/input/ 
			directory in the kernel source. 
			Addition to this file is the detection of double right click along with 
			sending the SIGTERM signal to the processes registered.
			Right click event happens if 2 clicks are seperated by atmost 20 jiffies.
			Process can register to get the SIGTERM signal when right double click happens,
			by sending their pid via ioclt command.
			ioctl function is also implemented with 2 cmds, 1 to register the pid
			and 2 to deregister the pid.

			To modify the existing driver , we had to change the minor number of the devices ,
			also modified the device filename from mouseX to my_mouseX.
			Added unlocked_ioctl to its fops file_operations structure , to add the functionality
			of registering and deregistering the pid.
			Each single click on mouse generate two events in mousedev_key_event function.
			We seperate the events based on the swithc case in that function.
			Implemented the logic to detect double click in the BTN_RIGHT case of the switch/case.

			Instead of sending SIGTERM signal via the kill_fasyc function which do not have capabilities 
			to send anything instead of SIGIO, used send_sig function which sends a signal to the 
			specific process given in the argument.

			

task3.c		---	This file contains imprecise computation implementation where , we calculate
			value of pi using the sum of infinite series. When we receive SIGTERM signal when
			double right click happens. We stop the computation and print the result , value of pi.
			[ Note: After you run ./task3 , move the mouse little bit so the application can determine
			        which mouse to select to read right double click and then use same mouse to 
				generate right double click .]



	Compilation
===================================================

To compile the module and test application:
$bash:~ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi- KDIR=<path-to-your-kernel-source>



	Usage
==================================================

To insert the module:
$bash:~ insmod my_mousedev.ko

To run the test application:
[This app is customized for beagleboard mouse and uses /dev/my_mouse0 but might not work on other system]

$bash:~ ./task3
The task3 application will wait for you till , you double right click the mouse.
