Embedded system programming project
-------------------------------------

Project 1 : A very basic character driver which implements a kernel memory buffer.
	    The buffer is initialized with a default string which containts the uptime of the system.
	    It also implments reader/writers lock so that multiple users can read but only 1 user can 
	    write at a time. Also contains the user-space application to test the driver.

Project 2 : Character Driver for Ring Buffer and Hardware Timer

Project 3 : I2C driver for EEPROM.

Project 4 : Implemented event driver for mouse
