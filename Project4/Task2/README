	task2.c
==================================

This directory contains single file named task2.c 

task2.c	  ---  This file shows the imprecise computation model , where
		we calculate value of pi using a sum of series.
 		We print the result after 1 sec of the computation.
		We use alarm() function with argument as 1 , so it 
		produces SIGALRM signal after 1 sec. And we handle the 
		signal and use longjmp function to go to the place where
		setjmp was called (inside the computation of pi).
		Deciding if we have reached setjmp from longjmp based on the 
		return value of the setjmp , we return from the function and 
		print the value.
		

	Compilation
